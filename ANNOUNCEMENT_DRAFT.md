# Draft for First Announcement

**Channel:** Crypto/Blockchain Telegram chat

**Message:**

Hello everyone!

I've been working on a project and would like to share a working prototype.

I've launched **Digital Notary DApp** — a decentralized service to register copyright for any digital content (code, design, text) on the blockchain.

**In simple terms:** you can now prove you created something at a specific time. The proof is recorded in the public Polygon blockchain and cannot be changed or deleted.

**What's ready:**
• Live app: https://digitalnotary.online
• Smart contract on Polygon: https://polygonscan.com/address/0xEa6130eBe3c79fa7f209568030EC78Ac321890C4
• Full cycle: register → verify → transfer rights

**For:** developers, designers, writers — anyone who creates digital content.

You can test it for free in test networks (Sepolia, Polygon Amoy).

I'd appreciate any feedback!
