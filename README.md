## 🌐 Live Application
**Available at:** [https://digitalnotary.online](https://digitalnotary.online)

## 🚀 Problem & Solution
Proving you were the first to create a piece of code, a design, or any digital asset can be difficult and legally complex. **Digital Notary DApp** solves this by allowing you to create a tamper-proof, timestamped proof of authorship on the blockchain in under 60 seconds, using a secure commit-reveal mechanism.

## ✨ Key Features
- **⚡ Instant Registration:** Get a blockchain timestamp for your work in about a minute.
- **🔐 Secure Commit-Reveal:** Patented technology protects against front-running and ensures your proof is recorded first.
- **⚖️ Legally Significant:** A permanent, immutable record on the Polygon blockchain serves as robust evidence.
- **🌐 Multi-Chain Support:** Deployed and functional across multiple testnets and mainnets (Polygon, Ethereum Sepolia, Polygon Amoy).

## 🌐 Browser Extension

**Quick access extension** for Chrome, Edge, and Firefox browsers.

### Extension Details
- **Type:** Zero-permission extension (Manifest V3)

## 🛡️ Proof of First & Authenticity
This project is the original implementation. Comprehensive cryptographic proof of authorship, deployment history, and code verification is documented and publicly available.

**👉 View the complete, verifiable proof chain here: [PROOF_OF_ORIGIN.md](./PROOF_OF_ORIGIN.md)**

The document includes:
- SHA256 hashes of all project snapshots.
- Blockchain transaction IDs for code registration on Polygon Mainnet.
- Contract deployment addresses and dates.
- A full version history of the project's development.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Pure client-side DApp)
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, OpenZeppelin Contracts (for security & standards)
- **Blockchain Networks:** Polygon Mainnet, Ethereum (Sepolia), Polygon (Amoy)
- **Deployment:** Frontend on Netlify, Contracts on multiple chains

## 🔐 Access to Source Code
The complete source code (smart contracts + frontend) is maintained in a private repository for intellectual property protection.

**Verification Process:** The SHA256 hash of the complete source code is permanently and immutably registered on the **Polygon Mainnet**. Any serious investor or partner can verify the provided code against this on-chain hash.
